# JengaStackGame

This project is a 3D Jenga-based educational game developed in Unity to help students understand and visualize the importance of mastering foundational concepts in a subject. The game represents concepts students should know as blocks in a Jenga tower, categorized by mastery levels. The project is inspired by the Common Core standards for grade-level competencies.

## Features

- Three distinct types of blocks representing student's mastery: Glass (not learned), Wood (learned but not tested), and Stone (tested and mastered).
- Five game modes including:
  - **Test my Stack**: Removes Glass blocks and tests the stability of the stack.
  - **Strengthen my Stack**: Assigns quizzes based on the Wood blocks to help students test their knowledge.
  - **Earthquake**: Shakes the ground to test the stack's stability.
  - **Build my Stack**: Predicts stack height when adding blocks from future grade levels.
  - **Challenge**: Multiplayer mode to challenge others.
- Three separate stacks representing different grade levels.
- Interactive camera controls to orbit around and switch focus between stacks.
- Detailed block information showing the grade level, domain, cluster, and standard description.
